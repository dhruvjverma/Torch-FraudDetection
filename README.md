# Torch-FraudDetection
This GitHub repository serves as an example demonstrating the usage of deep learning with PyTorch for credit card
fraud detection. The main objective is to build and train a machine learning model that can predict whether a
transaction is likely to be fraudulent or genuine based on certain features such as amount, time, location, etc.,
available in the dataset.

The project is set up using modern deep learning libraries like PyTorch for its flexibility, extensibility and
ease of use. The code includes various stages including data processing and preprocessing, model creation with
hyperparameter tuning using cross validation techniques to ensure that our models are robust against unseen data,
training the model on a large labeled dataset, evaluating the performance of these models by implementing metrics
like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc., and visualizing the results if any.

Key features include:
- Data Loading: Utilizes PyTorch's `DataLoader` for efficient batch processing of data from a CSV file.
- Preprocessing: Includes transformations on the dataset to prepare it for training, such as scaling numerical
columns and one-hot encoding categorical ones.
- Model Creation: Uses PyTorch's nn module to define a neural network architecture suitable for binary
classification tasks like fraud detection. This includes stacking multiple layers (like `Linear` and `ReLU`) along
with defining forward propagation behavior in the `forward()` method of the model class.
- Training: Uses backpropagation, an optimization algorithm that adjusts the weights of our neural network to
minimize error, allowing it to learn from data patterns. The model is trained over a number of epochs or
iterations, and learning rate tuning helps in faster convergence by updating the weights based on gradients
calculated through backpropagation.
- Evaluation: Uses metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score for evaluation which are important metrics
used to assess performance in binary classification tasks.
- Visualization: Includes visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves that provide a more nuanced
understanding of the model's performance.

This repository serves as an example on how one can leverage PyTorch to build robust models for detecting
fraudulent credit card transactions, making it accessible to developers who are new to deep learning or simply
wanting to understand the process better. It is designed in a way that allows modifications and further
enhancements based on user requirements.
